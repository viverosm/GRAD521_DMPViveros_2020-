Data Management Plan 

Project Context: This study will examine perceptions of gender and masculinity in self-identified male students enrolled in Multicultural Education (ED 219) at Oregon State University. Being the instructor of ED 219 and my previous experience conducting research about the experiences of college male students in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies courses, have informed my current research interest in studying how male students in ED 219 perceive masculinity; what factors impact these perceptions; how students make sense of different concepts of masculinity; and how studentsâ€™ understanding of these concepts impact the formation of their future career as (potential)educators. ED 219 is a social justice-oriented course where students are exposed to the learning and critical discussions of gender issues, race, and other topics. Therefore, I believe it is crucial and pertinent to study how male students perceive gender and how they make sense of masculinity in order to explore ways to promote gender equality in this particular educational setting.
