# Data Description
This study will examine perceptions of gender and masculinity in self-identified male students enrolled in Multicultural Education (ED 219) at Oregon State University. Being the instructor of ED 219 and my previous experience conducting research about the experiences of college male students in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies courses, have informed my current research interest in studying how male students in ED 219 perceive masculinity; what factors impact these perceptions; how students make sense of different concepts of masculinity; and how students’ understanding of these concepts impact the formation of their future career as (potential)educators. ED 219 is a social justice-oriented course where students are exposed to the learning and critical discussions of gender issues, race, and other topics. Therefore, I believe it is crucial and pertinent to study how male students perceive gender and how they make sense of masculinity in order to explore ways to promote gender equality in this particular educational setting. 

# Roles and responsibilities
1.	For my dissertation I am already collecting data. As I stated in my DMP 1, I will use course assignments as part of my data. Primarily I am working with my advisor and in terms of data protection, all data entry is taking place in Box where my advisor and I can access with our OSU accounts. Only my advisor and I have access to this folder. I have the responsibility to label and organize the data we have. While I am doing this, I am labeling each student’s assignment with a code to protect students’ personal information. The code consists of the students’ initials, the type of assignment, and term. Each assignment is placed in a folder organized depending on the type of assignment and term. As I am learning more about DMP strategies, I have been talking with my advisor to create a plan to manage our data. I will be responsible to implement this plan in the future. Since I am planning in staying at OSU and keep working with my advisor until I finish my PhD, there is no risk of identifying a contingency plan. 

2.	Legal documents related to my research only include documents that were submitted to IRB and that were approved. No other legal documents are identified as part of my research project. Also, this is not a funded research, therefore there will be no documents associated with a grant or fellowship.
